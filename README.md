**Introduction**
This project aims to recognize various agricultural crops from an image provided via a URL. Using deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the model is trained on a dataset of crop images. It can classify images into predefined crop categories with a high degree of accuracy.

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (based on your framework choice)
NumPy
OpenCV or Pillow (for image processing)
Requests (for downloading images from URLs)

**Model Architecture**
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. You can use a pre-trained model like MobileNetV2 or ResNet50 and fine-tune it for your specific dataset.

**Training the Model**
Once the model is built, you can train it using the crop dataset. The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the performance metric.

**Evaluation**
After training, the model can be evaluated on the validation dataset:

**Usage**
Recognizing Crops from Image URLs
To predict a crop from an image URL, you can:

Download the image from the provided URL.
Preprocess the image (resize, normalize, etc.).
Pass the preprocessed image to the model for prediction.
